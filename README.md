## üí° Prompt Examples for Claude AI

### üéØ **IMPORTANT: How to Create Workflows with Claude**

To create workflows successfully, you **MUST** explicitly ask Claude to:
1. **Create the workflow in n8n via MCP**
2. **Make the connections between components**

### ‚úÖ **Correct Prompts Examples**

#### Create a Complete Webhook to Email Workflow
```
"Use the n8n MCP tools to create a new workflow in n8n that:
1. Receives webhook data via POST
2. Processes the incoming data
3. Sends an email notification
4. Returns a success response

Please create this workflow in n8n and ensure all nodes are properly connected."
```

#### Create a Data Processing Pipeline
```
"Create a workflow in n8n using the MCP server that:
1. Starts with a webhook trigger
2. Adds a function node to transform the data
3. Connects to a database to store results
4. Sends a Slack notification when complete

Make sure to create all connections between the nodes."
```

#### Create from Template and Customize
```
"Use the n8n MCP to create a workflow from the webhook_to_email template, then customize it to:
1. Add data validation before processing
2. Include error handling
3. Connect all nodes properly

Create this in n8n and verify all connections work."
```

#### Monitor and Debug Existing Workflows
```
"Use the n8n MCP tools to:
1. List all my current workflows
2. Show the execution history for the last workflow
3. Check if there are any failed executions

If there are issues, help me understand what went wrong."
```

### ‚ùå **Avoid These Incomplete Prompts**

```
‚ùå "Create a webhook workflow" (too vague)
‚ùå "Show me how to make a workflow" (doesn't use MCP)
‚ùå "I need email automation" (no action specified)
```

### üîß **Advanced Workflow Creation**

#### Complex Multi-Step Automation
```
"Create a comprehensive workflow in n8n via MCP that:
1. Webhook trigger for incoming customer data
2. Function node to validate and clean the data
3. Conditional logic to route based on customer type
4. Different email templates for different customer types
5. Database storage for all interactions
6. Slack notification to the sales team

Please create this workflow in n8n, ensure all nodes are connected properly, and activate it."
```

#### Error Handling and Monitoring
```
"Use the n8n MCP to create a robust workflow with:
1. HTTP request to external API
2. Error handling for failed requests
3. Retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Success/failure notifications
5. Data logging for monitoring

Create this in n8n with proper node connections and test it."
```

### üìä **Workflow Management**

#### List and Analyze
```
"Use the n8n MCP tools to show me all my workflows, their status, and recent execution results. Help me identify which ones need attention."
```

#### Update Existing Workflow
```
"Use the n8n MCP to update workflow ID [123] by adding a new email notification step after the data processing node. Make sure all connections are maintained."
```

### üöÄ **Advanced Connection Types**

#### Create Workflow with Merge Connections
```
"Use create_advanced_workflow with connection type 'merge' to create a workflow that:
1. Receives data from multiple webhook sources
2. Merges all incoming data using append mode
3. Processes the combined dataset
4. Sends consolidated report

Include merge, error handling, and parallel processing connections."
```

#### Create Switch-Based Routing Workflow
```
"Create an advanced workflow using switch connections that:
1. Receives webhook data
2. Routes data to different processors based on content type
3. Applies different business logic per route
4. Handles errors with retry logic

Use connection type 'switch' with conditional routing rules."
```

#### Create AI-Enhanced Workflow
```
"Build an advanced workflow with AI enrichment connections:
1. Webhook receives customer feedback
2. AI analyzes sentiment and categorizes content
3. Routes positive feedback to success team
4. Routes negative feedback to support with priority
5. Stores insights in database with temporal scheduling

Use 'ai_enrichment' connection type with sentiment analysis."
```

#### Create Complex Loop Processing
```
"Create a workflow with loop connections that:
1. Fetches large dataset from API
2. Processes items in batches of 50
3. Applies transformations to each batch
4. Handles rate limiting with delays
5. Aggregates results with error recovery

Use 'loops' connection type with batch processing configuration."
```

#### Create Enterprise Error Handling
```
"Build a robust workflow with comprehensive error handling:
1. Multi-step data processing pipeline
2. Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Circuit breaker patterns
4. Fallback data sources
5. Comprehensive error notifications

Use 'error_handling' connection type with retry configuration."
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### üîß **Advanced Connection System**

Our MCP server now supports **25+ advanced connection types** based on analysis of 2000+ n8n workflows and official documentation:

#### **Priority 1: Critical Connections**
- **Merge/Split Connections**: Append, byKey, position, combinations
- **Switch Routing**: Multi-path conditional routing with rules
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, fallback patterns

#### **Priority 2: Important Connections**
- **Advanced Webhook**: Multi-method support (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- **Loop Connections**: forEach, while, recursive with batch processing
- **Temporal Connections**: Delays, schedules, timeouts

#### **Priority 3: Advanced Features**
- **AI Enrichment**: Sentiment analysis, classification, dynamic routing
- **Dynamic Sources**: Context-aware, personalized, data-driven endpoints
- **Parallel Processing**: Load balancing, race conditions, synchronization
- **Stateful Connections**: Sessions, caching, cross-workflow state

### Progressive API Handling
The server uses a **3-tier fallback approach** for maximum compatibility:

1. **Minimal Structure** - Basic workflow creation
2. **Settings Added** - If API requires settings object
3. **Complete Structure** - Full n8n workflow format

### Robust Error Handling
- **Contextual error messages** with actionable solutions
- **Debug information** for troubleshooting
- **Connection diagnostics** for API issues
- **Validation suggestions** based on best practices

### MCP Resources Integration
- **Dynamic resource discovery** from live n8n instance
- **Template management** with categorized workflows
